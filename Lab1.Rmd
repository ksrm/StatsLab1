## Problem 1
Compute the sum of the sequence 100 to 1000, going up by a constant value of 100 (100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000).
```{r}
sum(seq(100, 1000, 100))
```

## Problem 2
Compute the sum of these numbers (1,3,2,4,3,5,4,3,4,5,6,5,6,7,6,5,6,5,4,3,4,5)
```{r}
x<-c(1,3,2,4,3,5,4,3,4,5,6,5,6,7,6,5,6,5,4,3,4,5)
sum(x)
```
## Problem 3
Write a custom sequence generator function using a for loop that generates a sequence from a starting integer value to an ending integer value in steps of 1. Demonstrate that it can produce the sequence 1 to 10.
```{r}

seq<-function(x,y,by){
  end<-y-by
while(x<=end){
  print(x)
  x<-x+by
}
print(y)}
seq(1,10,2)
seq(1,10,1)
seq(1,20,3)
```
